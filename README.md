## Project Overview

This deep learning project leverages the [BraTS (Brain Tumor Segmentation)](https://www.med.upenn.edu/cbica/brats2021/data.html) dataset for brain tumor detection, classification, and segmentation. In addition, it incorporates eXplainable AI (XAI) techniques to generate preventive measures and track patient progress.

The primary objectives of this project include:

- Detecting the presence of brain tumors within medical imaging data.
- Classifying the detected tumors into different categories (e.g., glioblastoma, meningioma).
- Segmenting the tumor regions within brain scans.
- Utilizing eXplainable AI to generate insights into preventive measures and monitor patient progress.

The project combines state-of-the-art deep learning models with advanced XAI techniques to enhance the diagnosis and treatment of brain tumors, ultimately improving patient care.

## Dataset

The project utilizes the [BraTS dataset](https://www.med.upenn.edu/cbica/brats2021/data.html), a benchmark in the field of brain tumor research. The dataset includes multi-modal brain scans, allowing for comprehensive analysis and diagnosis. Researchers and contributors can access and download the dataset through the provided link.

## Model Architecture

Our deep learning model is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, which has been optimized for brain tumor detection, classification, and segmentation. The model's architecture and training details are available in the project's source code and documentation.

## Usage

To use this project for brain tumor detection, classification, and segmentation:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies as listed in the project's requirements file.

3. Preprocess and prepare your own brain imaging data or utilize the BraTS dataset.

4. Train the deep learning model using your data or the BraTS dataset.

5. Evaluate the model's performance on your test data.

For the XAI analysis, please refer to the documentation in the project repository for specific usage instructions.

## XAI Analysis

eXplainable AI (XAI) is an integral part of this project, providing interpretable insights into brain tumor detection and tracking patient progress. The XAI component includes the following features:

- Interpretability of model predictions.
- Visualizations of segmented tumor regions.
- Generation of preventive measures based on patient data.

For detailed usage and examples of the XAI features, please refer to the project's documentation.

## Results

The project has achieved significant milestones in brain tumor detection, classification, and segmentation. Detailed results, including accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and XAI-generated insights, can be found in the project's documentation.
